### Summary
PUTMAN is a compact, implementable architecture for modeling **interpretation shift** in recursive symbolic systems. Meaning is represented as a **weighted, typed relational structure** that is selectively activated under contextual constraints and reconstructed into ranked candidate interpretations. The framework includes modulators for **affect (E)**, **recursion depth (d)**, and **rigidity (ρ)**, plus minimal examples, a minimal evaluation protocol, and reference pseudocode.
